    - In the DeFi space I prefer to work with anon identities but I am open to disclose some of them in the right discussion, here are some projects I am working on atm 
      - Solidity 
        - Based in Perpetuals 
          - Building an Algorithmic Stablecoin (anon) 
          - Building a new DEX (anon)
          - Building Synths (anon)
    - Researching on Integrating protocols like [Perpetual Protocol](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol), [Squeeth](https://github.com/opynfinance/squeeth-monorepo) and more 
    - Arbitrage Bots 
    - Researching on Oracle: mostly Chainlink and the Umbrella Network
